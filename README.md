# A-BTesting

* Hands-on demonstration of A/B testing using real-world data from Kaggle! By using kaggle API to get the dataset that examines the conversion status when an ad is displayed to a test group versus a general public service announcement.

* The journey begins with a meticulous exploration of the dataset, which includes variables such as the day of the week with the highest ad displays, the hour of the day with the most ad displays, and the total number of ads shown to prospects. Pairing each variable with the conversion status, creating insightful visualizations like stacked bar charts, pie charts, and box plots to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

* Performed a proper chi-squared test of dependence to assess the relationship between categorical variables and the conversion status.
